# Stephanie-Jones-Password-Generator

## Description

This project was my first attempt at writing javascript code. It took so long and I learned so much. Writing functions is the most difficult part but it is getting better. This code prompts the user to choose the number of characters and then decide the types of characters to include.

## Credits

While I didn't work directly with anyone on this project, my cohort group helped answer many of my questions. I really enjoy the collaborative nature of this program.  I also received help from a tutor. I also used the following sites for help and suggestions.
